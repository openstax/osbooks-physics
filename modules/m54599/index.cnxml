<title>The Role of Units</title>
<para id="fs-id1167066123363">Physicists, like other scientists, make observations and ask basic questions. For example, how big is an object? How much mass does it have? How far did it travel? To answer these questions, they make measurements with various instruments (e.g., meter stick, balance, stopwatch, etc.).</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065861733">The measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized values. For example, the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for long distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a meaningful way (<link target-id="Figure_01_03_map"/>).</para><figure id="Figure_01_03_map"><media id="fs-id1167065808804" alt="A person is standing in front of a map that has cable as units.

<title>SI Units: Fundamental and Derived Units</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065837905">In any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process. These are called the <term id="term-00002">base quantities</term> for that system and their units are the system’s <term id="term-00003">base units</term>. All other physical quantities can then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a <term id="term-00004">derived quantity</term> and each unit is called a <term id="term-00005">derived unit</term>. The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the derived units can be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the base units from which they are derived.</para><note id="fs-id1167065884693" class="os-teacher">

For example, Britain still uses the pint to measure beer, miles to measure road distances, and pounds to measure body weight (although weight must be reported in kg in British medical records). The British people still use the British system extensively in their everyday lives, but the metric system is the official standard for the government. Likewise, many oil-producing countries measure oil in British gallons.</para>

<title>The Meter</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065860859">The SI unit for length is the <emphasis effect="bold">meter</emphasis> (m). The definition of the meter has changed over time to become more accurate and precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar. (The bar is now housed at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, near Paris). By 1960, some distances could be measured more precisely by comparing them to wavelengths of light. The meter was redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/ 299,792,458 of a second (<link target-id="Figure_01_03_flashlight"/>).</para><figure id="Figure_01_03_flashlight"><media id="fs-id1167065824041" alt="A shining flashlight is placed over top a meter stick to illustrate that the meter is defined as the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second through a vacuum.">

<title>The Kilogram</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065882588">The SI unit for mass is the <emphasis effect="bold">kilogram</emphasis> (abbreviated kg); it was previously defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact replicas of the previously defined kilogram are also kept at the United States’ National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland outside of Washington D.C., and at other locations around the world. The determination of all other masses could be ultimately traced to a comparison with the standard mass. Even though the platinum-iridium cylinder was resistant to corrosion, airborne contaminants were able to adhere to its surface, slightly changing its mass over time. In May 2019, the scientific community adopted a more stable definition of the kilogram. The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second, the meter, and Planck's constant, <emphasis effect="italics">h</emphasis> (a quantum mechanical value that relates a photon's energy to its frequency).

<title>The Second</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065845467">The SI unit for time, the <emphasis effect="bold">second</emphasis> (s) also has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of an average solar day. However, the average solar day is actually very gradually getting longer due to gradual slowing of Earth’s rotation. Accuracy in the fundamental units is essential, since all other measurements are derived from them. Therefore, a new standard was adopted to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon. One constant phenomenon is the very steady vibration of Cesium atoms, which can be observed and counted. This vibration forms the basis of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">cesium atomic clock</term>. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 Cesium atom vibrations (<link target-id="Figure_01_03_clock"/>).</para><figure id="Figure_01_03_clock"><media id="fs-id1167066057171" alt="A photograph shows an atomic clock.

<para id="fs-id1167065824610"><span>[BL]</span>An average solar day was used to originally define the second because the length of a solar day varies throughout the year due to Earth’s tilt of its axis as well as its elliptical orbit. The accumulation of these variations could result in a day length difference of up to 16 minutes during different seasons. Using an average solar day resolves these variations in day length.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065875814">The SI unit of temperature is the <term id="term-00007">kelvin</term> (or kelvins, but not degrees kelvin). This scale is named after physicist William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who was the first to call for an absolute temperature scale. The Kelvin scale is based on absolute zero. This is the point at which all thermal energy has been removed from all atoms or molecules in a system. This temperature, 0 K, is equal to −273.15 °C and −459.67 °F. Conveniently, the Kelvin scale actually changes in the same way as the Celsius scale. For example, the freezing point (0 °C) and boiling points of water (100 °C) are 100 degrees apart on the Celsius scale. These two temperatures are also 100 kelvins apart (freezing point = 273.15 K; boiling point = 373.15 K).</para>

Another advantage of the metric system is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by switching to the most-appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances in meters are suitable for building construction, but kilometers are used to describe road construction. Therefore, with the metric system, there is no need to invent new units when measuring very small or very large objects—you just have to move the decimal point (and use the appropriate prefix).</para>

<title>Using Scientific Notation with Physical Measurements</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065734158"><term id="term-00011">Scientific notation</term> is a way of writing numbers that are too large or small to be conveniently written as a decimal.

Placeholder zeros are those at the end of a number that is 10 or greater, and at the beginning of a decimal number that is less than 1. In the example above, the factor is 10<sup>14</sup>. This tells you that you should move the decimal point 14 positions to the right, filling in placeholder zeros as you go.

<title>Unit Conversion and Dimensional Analysis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065972575">It is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook in the United States, some quantities may be expressed in liters and you need to convert them to cups. A Canadian tourist driving through the United States might want to convert miles to kilometers, to have a sense of how far away his next destination is. A doctor in the United States might convert a patient’s weight in pounds to kilograms.</para><para id="fs-id1167065848457">Let’s consider a simple example of how to convert units within the metric system.

A <term id="term-00013">conversion factor</term> is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. A conversion factor is simply a fraction which equals 1. You can multiply any number by 1 and get the same value. When you multiply a number by a conversion factor, you are simply multiplying it by one. For example, the following are conversion factors: (1 foot)/(12 inches) = 1 to convert inches to feet, (1 meter)/(100 centimeters) = 1 to convert centimeters to meters, (1 minute)/(60 seconds) = 1 to convert seconds to minutes.</para><para id="fs-id1167064911606">Now we can set up our unit conversion.

<item>Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average speed in units of km/h and we have indeed obtained these units.</item>
<item>Check the significant figures. Because each of the values given in the problem has three significant figures, the answer should also have three significant figures. The answer 30.0 km/h does indeed have three significant figures, so this is appropriate.

<item>Next, check whether the answer is reasonable. Let us consider some information from the problem—if you travel 10 km in a third of an hour (20 min), you would travel three times that far in an hour. The answer does seem reasonable.</item>

<title>Accuracy, Precision and Significant Figures</title>
<para id="fs-id1167066032989">Science is based on experimentation that requires good measurements. The validity of a measurement can be described in terms of its accuracy and its precision (see <link target-id="Figure_01_03_pan"/> and <link target-id="Figure_01_03_balance"/>). <term id="term-00014">Accuracy</term> is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard piece of printer paper. The packaging in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11 inches long, and suppose this stated value is correct. You measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 inches, 11.2 inches, and 10.9 inches. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches. In contrast, if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches, your measurement would not be very accurate. This is why measuring instruments are calibrated based on a known measurement. If the instrument consistently returns the correct value of the known measurement, it is safe for use in finding unknown values.</para>

<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_pan.jpg"/>
</media>

<caption>A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass is placed in one pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is horizontal, then the masses in both pans are equal. The known masses are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1 gram, 10 grams, and 100 grams. (Serge Melki)</caption></figure><figure id="Figure_01_03_balance"><media id="fs-id1167065897826" alt="A plastic pen cap is sitting on a digital scale and has a measured mass of 0.98 grams.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_balance.jpg"/>
</media>

<caption>Whereas a mechanical balance may only read the mass of an object to the nearest tenth of a gram, some digital scales can measure the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram. As in other measuring devices, the precision of a scale is limited to the last measured figures. This is the hundredths place in the scale pictured here. (Splarka, Wikimedia Commons)</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1167065938277"><term id="term-00015">Precision</term> states how well repeated measurements of something generate the same or similar results. Therefore, the precision of measurements refers to how close together the measurements are when you measure the same thing several times. One way to analyze the precision of measurements would be to determine the range, or difference between the lowest and the highest measured values. In the case of the printer paper measurements, the lowest value was 10.9 inches and the highest value was 11.2 inches. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 inches. These measurements were reasonably precise because they varied by only a fraction of an inch. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 inches, 11.1 inches, and 11.9 inches, then the measurements would not be very precise because there is a lot of variation from one measurement to another.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065859470">The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider a GPS system that is attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target. Then think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot on the bull’s eye.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065771045">In <link target-id="Figure_01_03_target_accuracy"/>, you can see that the GPS measurements are spread far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low precision, high accuracy measuring system. However, in <link target-id="Figure_01_03_target_precision"/>, the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system. Finally, in <link target-id="Figure_01_03_target_both"/>, the GPS is both precise and accurate, allowing the restaurant to be located.</para>

<title>Uncertainty</title>
<para id="fs-id1167066089234">The accuracy and precision of a measuring system determine the <term id="term-00016">uncertainty</term> of its measurements. Uncertainty is a way to describe your confidence in your measured value, or the range of values that would be consistent with the data. If your measurements are not very accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high. In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought of as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are indicating that the actual mileage of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500 miles, or anywhere in between. All measurements contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example of measuring the length of the paper, we might say that the length of the paper is 11 inches plus or minus 0.2 inches or 11.0 ± 0.2 inches. The uncertainty in a measurement, <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis>, is often denoted as <emphasis effect="italics">δA</emphasis> ("delta <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis>"). The actual value of the object may not be within the range given by the measurement and its uncertainty. In our paper length example above, a new set of measurements might produce a length of 14.0 ± 0.2 inches, with the uncertainty based on the accuracy or our reading or repeated measurements. We would also, however, conclude that either one of our measurement sets is incorrect due to an offset in the measurement process in that set, or our measurement correctly identifies that we are measuring  different papers. In the former case, the discrepancy between the measured value and the actual value is called a systematic error.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065861362">The factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:</para>
<list id="fs-id1167065822481" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>Limitations of the measuring device</item>
<item>The skill of the person making the measurement</item>
<item>Irregularities in the object being measured</item>
<item>Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation)</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-id1167065773751">In the printer paper example uncertainty could be caused by: the fact that the smallest division on the ruler is 0.1 inches, the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, or uncertainty caused by the paper cutting machine (e.g., one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other.) It is good practice to carefully consider all possible sources of uncertainty in a measurement and reduce or eliminate them.</para>

<title>Uncertainty in Calculations</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065879809">There is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the both the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements in the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the <term id="term-00017">method of adding percents</term> can be used. This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m<sup>2</sup> and has an uncertainty of 3 percent (expressed as an area this is 0.36 m<sup>2</sup>, which we round to 0.4 m<sup>2</sup> since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter).</para>

<title>Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065968516">An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements is the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, consider measuring the thickness of a coin. A standard ruler can measure thickness to the nearest millimeter, while a micrometer can measure the thickness to the nearest 0.005 millimeter. The micrometer is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in thickness. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065859019">When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our measuring tool (such as the rulers shown in <link target-id="Figure_01_03_rulers"/>). For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may measure it with a decimeter ruler as 3.6 cm. You could not express this value as 3.65 cm because your measuring tool was not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices that the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36 mm and 37 mm. He or she must estimate the value of the last digit. The rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. For example, the last measured value 36.5 mm has three digits, or three significant figures. The number of <term id="term-00018">significant figures</term> in a measurement indicates the precision of the measuring tool. The more precise a measuring tool is, the greater the number of significant figures it can report.</para><figure id="Figure_01_03_rulers"><media id="fs-id1167065794516" alt="The stick can be measured with increasing accuracy as we use smaller and smaller scales of measurement.">

<title>Zeros</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065747812">Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. For example, the zeros in 0.053 are not significant because they are only placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053—the 5 and the 3. However, if the zero occurs between other significant figures, the zeros are significant. For example, both zeros in 10.053 are significant, as these zeros were actually measured. Therefore, the 10.053 placeholder has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last zero, or the zeros could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, write 1300 in scientific notation as 1.3 × 10<sup>3</sup>. Only significant figures are given in the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis> factor for a number in scientific notation (in the form  <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>x</m:mi><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mi>y</m:mi></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math> ). Therefore, we know that 1 and 3 are the only significant digits in this number. In summary, zeros are significant except when they serve only as placeholders. <link target-id="Table_10_03_sigfigs"/> provides examples of the number of significant figures in various numbers.</para><table id="Table_10_03_sigfigs" summary="A three column, nine row table is shown The header row contains the following column titles: number, significant figures, and rationale.

<title>Graphing in Physics</title>
<para id="fs-id1167066039109">Most results in science are presented in scientific journal articles using graphs. Graphs present data in a way that is easy to visualize for humans in general, especially someone unfamiliar with what is being studied. They are also useful for presenting large amounts of data or data with complicated trends in an easily-readable way.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065847579">One commonly-used graph in physics and other sciences is the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">line graph</term>, probably because it is the best graph for showing how one quantity changes in response to the other.

<list id="fs-id1167066103979" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item>Draw the two axes. The horizontal axis, or <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis, shows the <term id="term-00021">independent variable</term>, which is the variable that is controlled or manipulated. The vertical axis, or <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-axis, shows the <term id="term-00022">dependent variable</term>, the non-manipulated variable that changes with (or is dependent on) the value of the independent variable. In the data above, time is the independent variable and should be plotted on the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis. Distance from the station is the dependent variable and should be plotted on the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-axis.</item>
<item>Label each axes on the graph with the name of each variable, followed by the symbol for its units in parentheses. Be sure to leave room so that you can number each axis. In this example, use <emphasis effect="italics">Time (min)</emphasis> as the label for the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis.</item>
<item>
<para id="fs-id1167066089075">Next, you must determine the best scale to use for numbering each axis. Because the time values on the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis are taken every 10 minutes, we could easily number the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis from 0 to 70 minutes with a tick mark every 10 minutes. Likewise, the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-axis scale should start low enough and continue high enough to include all of the <emphasis effect="italics">distance from station</emphasis> values. A scale from 0 km to 160 km should suffice, perhaps with a tick mark every 10 km.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065860896">In general, you want to pick a scale for both axes that 1) shows all of your data, and 2) makes it easy to identify trends in your data. If you make your scale too large, it will be harder to see how your data change. Likewise, the smaller and more fine you make your scale, the more space you will need to make the graph. The number of significant figures in the axis values should be coarser than the number of significant figures in the measurements.</para>
</item>
<item>Now that your axes are ready, you can begin plotting your data. For the first data point, count along the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis until you find the 10 min tick mark. Then, count up from that point to the 10 km tick mark on the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-axis, and approximate where 22 km is along the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-axis. Place a dot at this location. Repeat for the other six data points (<link target-id="Figure_01_03_point"/>).

<item>Add a title to the top of the graph to state what the graph is describing, such as the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-axis parameter vs. the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis parameter. In the graph shown here, the title is <emphasis effect="italics">train motion</emphasis>. It could also be titled distance of the train from the station vs. time.
</item>
<item>Finally, with data points now on the graph, you should draw a trend line (<link target-id="Figure_01_03_trendline"/>). The trend line represents the dependence you think the graph represents, so that the person who looks at your graph can see how close it is to the real data. In the present case, since the data points look like they ought to fall on a straight line, you would draw a straight line as the trend line. Draw it to come closest to all the points. Real data may have some inaccuracies, and the plotted points may not all fall on the trend line. In some cases, none of the data points fall exactly on the trend line.

<section id="fs-id1167066037609"><title>Using Logarithmic Scales in Graphing</title><para id="fs-id1167066096687">Sometimes a variable can have a very large range of values. This presents a problem when you’re trying to figure out the best scale to use for your graph’s axes. One option is to use a <term id="term-00030">logarithmic (log) scale</term>. In a logarithmic scale, the value each mark labels is the previous mark’s value multiplied by some constant. For a log base 10 scale, each mark labels a value that is 10 times the value of the mark before it. Therefore, a base 10 logarithmic scale would be numbered: 0, 10, 100, 1,000, etc. You can see how the logarithmic scale covers a much larger range of values than the corresponding linear scale, in which the marks would label the values 0, 10, 20, 30, and so on.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065863184">If you use a logarithmic scale on one axis of the graph and a linear scale on the other axis, you are using a <term id="term-00031">semi-log plot</term>. The Richter scale, which measures the strength of earthquakes, uses a semi-log plot. The degree of ground movement is plotted on a logarithmic scale against the assigned intensity level of the earthquake, which ranges linearly from 1-10 (<link target-id="Figure_01_03_richter"/> <emphasis>(a)</emphasis>). </para>

The x-axis is labeled Wavelength in centimeters and has a scale from ten to the power of negative six through ten to the power of negative eight.

<item>Physical quantities are a characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements.</item>
<item>The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature.</item>
<item>Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units.</item>
<item>Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value.</item>
<item>Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements.</item>
<item>Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool.</item>
<item>When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value.</item>
