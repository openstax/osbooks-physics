<para id="fs-idp30183856">If you have ever stubbed your toe, you have noticed that although your toe initiates the impact, the surface that you stub it on exerts a force back on your toe. Although the first thought that crosses your mind is probably “ouch, that hurt” rather than “this is a great example of Newton’s third law,” both statements are true.</para>
<para id="fs-idp62593200">This is exactly what happens whenever one object exerts a force on another—each object experiences a force that is the same strength as the force acting on the other object but that acts in the opposite direction. Everyday experiences, such as stubbing a toe or throwing a ball, are all perfect examples of Newton’s third law in action.</para>
<para id="fs-idm14932656"><term id="term-00001">Newton’s third law of motion</term> states that whenever a first object exerts a force on a second object, the first object experiences a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.</para>
<para id="fs-idp73541968">Newton’s third law of motion tells us that forces always occur in pairs, and one object cannot exert a force on another without experiencing the same strength force in return. We sometimes refer to these force pairs as <emphasis effect="italics">action-reaction</emphasis> pairs, where the force exerted is the action, and the force experienced in return is the reaction (although which is which depends on your point of view). </para>
<para id="fs-idp68039024">Newton’s third law is useful for figuring out which forces are external to a system. Recall that identifying external forces is important when setting up a problem, because the external forces must be added together to find the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">net force</term>.</para><para id="fs-idp5085584">We can see Newton’s third law at work by looking at how people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off from the side of a pool, as illustrated in <link target-id="Figure_04_04_swimmer"/>. She pushes against the pool wall with her feet and accelerates in the direction opposite to her push. The wall has thus exerted on the swimmer a force of equal magnitude but in the direction opposite that of her push. You might think that two forces of equal magnitude but that act in opposite directions would cancel, <emphasis effect="italics">but they do not because they act on different systems.</emphasis></para>

As a teacher paces in front of a whiteboard, he exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force in the forward direction on the teacher that causes him to accelerate forward. Similarly, a car accelerates because the ground pushes forward on the car's wheels in reaction to the car's wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks backward.</para>
<para id="fs-idp80457040">Another example is the force of a baseball as it makes contact with the bat. Helicopters create lift by pushing air down, creating an upward reaction force. Birds fly by exerting force on air in the direction opposite that in which they wish to fly. For example, the wings of a bird force air downward and backward in order to get lift and move forward. An octopus propels itself forward in the water by ejecting water backward through a funnel in its body, which is similar to how a jet ski is propelled. In these examples, the octopus or jet ski push the water backward, and the water, in turn, pushes the octopus or jet ski forward.</para>

<para id="fs-idp59478640">Forces are classified and given names based on their source, how they are transmitted, or their effects. In previous sections, we discussed the forces called <emphasis effect="italics">push</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">weight</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">friction</emphasis>. In this section, applying Newton’s third law of motion will allow us to explore three more forces: the <term id="term-00005">normal force</term>, <term id="term-00006">tension</term>, and <term id="term-00007">thrust</term>. However, because we haven’t yet covered vectors in depth, we’ll only consider one-dimensional situations in this chapter. Another chapter will consider forces acting in two dimensions. As we will see, we often apply the third law in conjunction with the second law in order to analyze the forces.</para>
<para id="fs-idm15080864">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">gravitational</term> force (or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">weight</term>) acts on objects at all times and everywhere on Earth. We know from Newton’s second law that a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">net force</term> produces an acceleration; so, why is everything not in a constant state of freefall toward the center of Earth? The answer is the normal force. The normal force is the outward force that a surface applies to an object perpendicular to the surface, and it prevents the object from penetrating it. The normal force is a third law reaction force to the object’s force into the surface. In the case of an object at rest on a horizontal surface, it is the force needed to support the weight of that object. If an object on a flat surface is not accelerating, the net external force is zero and, as a consequence of Newton's second (not third!) law, the normal force has the same magnitude as the weight of the system but acts in the opposite direction. In equation form, we write that</para><equation id="fs-idm31189056">

<para id="fs-idp24334256">Note that this equation is only true for a horizontal surface. This does not violate the third law since gravity and the normal force are not third law pairs.</para>
<para id="fs-idp67863456">The word <emphasis effect="italics">tension</emphasis> comes from the Latin word meaning <emphasis effect="italics">to stretch</emphasis>. Tension is the force along the length of a flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, or cable. Regardless of the type of connector attached to the object of interest, one must remember that the connector can only pull (or <emphasis effect="italics">exert tension</emphasis>) in the direction <emphasis effect="italics">parallel</emphasis> to its length. Tension is a pull that acts parallel to the connector, and that acts in opposite directions at the two ends of the connector. This is possible because a flexible connector is simply a long series of action-reaction forces, except at the two ends where outside objects provide one member of the action-reaction forces.</para>
<para id="fs-idm5482704">Consider a person holding a mass on a rope, as shown in <link target-id="Figure_04_04_rope"/>.</para>
<figure id="Figure_04_04_rope">
<media id="fs-idp21617728" alt="A hand is pulling downward on a rope with an object labeled m for mass attached to the bottom of the rope. A tension force vector from the hand points downward and another tension force vector from the object points upward. A weight force vector from the object points downward. The rope is the medium that transmits between the two objects' forces of equal magnitude but that act in opposite directions.">

<caption>When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend it) such as a rope transmits a force <emphasis>T</emphasis>, this force must be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. The pull that such a flexible connector exerts is a tension. The rope pulls at one end on the hand with equal magnitude force but in opposite directions to the hand’s pull. At the other end, it pulls on the mass with equal magnitude force and in the opposite direction to the mass’s pull. These are examples of Newton’s third law. If we neglect the weight of the rope, or if the system is at rest, Newton’s second law then leads to the forces at the two ends being equal.</caption>

<para id="fs-idm35244080">None of the forces between components of the system, such as between the teacher’s hands and the cart, contribute to the net external force because they are internal to the system. Another way to look at this is to note that the forces between components of a system cancel because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, the force exerted by the teacher on the cart is of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction of the force exerted by the cart on the teacher. In this case, both forces act on the same system, so they cancel. Defining the system was crucial to solving this problem.</para></commentary>
